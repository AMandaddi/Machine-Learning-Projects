**House Price Prediction using Machine Learning**

This Python-based project aims to predict house prices using various machine learning models. The workflow includes comprehensive data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

**Key Highlights:**

-**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed a thorough analysis of the dataset to understand trends, visualize feature relationships, and detect correlations using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

-**Feature Engineering:** Addressed missing values, handled outliers, transformed skewed distributions, and created new variables to enhance model performance. Categorical features were encoded for better model accuracy.

-**Model Development:** Built and compared multiple models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting, with hyperparameter tuning to optimize results.

-**Evaluation:** Evaluated models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ², and analyzed prediction errors to enhance model robustness.
Technologies Used

**Languages & Libraries:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

**Tools:** Jupyter Notebook

**Future Enhancements**

-Advanced Models: Incorporate advanced algorithms like XGBoost and LightGBM to further improve prediction accuracy.
